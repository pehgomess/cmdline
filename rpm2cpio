Examining the Contents of an Source RPM

An RPM is a special binary format that contains metadata, cryptographic signature, and an archive of package files. The file archive itself is usually a cpio archive. Use the rpm command itself to view the metadata, and use the rpm2cpio command to extract the cpio archive; the cpio command works on the resulting archive.

View source RPM metadata
rpm --query --package --info foo-1.0-1.src.rpm
Note: There are many options besides “--info” to get metadata from an RPM; see the rpm man page or other documentation.
Unpacking an source RPM file archive
rpm2cpio foo-1.0-1.src.rpm | cpio --extract --make-directories --verbose
Setting Up the RPM Build Environment

Before building an source RPM, a few bits of infrastructure must be in place. Below is one of the many possible ways to set up a build environment.

Make sure that rpmbuild and friends are available
yum install rpm-build
Establish a “root” directory for RPMs and related files
mkdir /your/working/directory/here/rpm
cd /your/working/directory/here/rpm
mkdir BUILD
mkdir RPMS
mkdir SOURCES
mkdir SPECS
mkdir SRPMS
Edit RPM config file to tell RPM where to find stuff
$HOME/.rpmmacros
Contents:
%_topdir    /your/working/directory/here/rpm
%_tmppath   %{_topdir}/tmp
Defaults and further information can be gleaned from:
/usr/lib/rpm/macros
Building a Source RPM

The rpmbuild command builds source and binary RPMs from an RPM spec file and its associated source files. A spec file defines several different stages for a full build (see below for more details), and the rpmbuild command gives you the choice of which stage to stop at.

Execute the preparatory stage
rpmbuild -bp /your/working/directory/here/rpm/SPECS/foo.spec
Execute the preparatory and build stages
rpmbuild -bc /your/working/directory/here/rpm/SPECS/foo.spec
Execute the preparatory, build, and install stages
rpmbuild -bi /your/working/directory/here/rpm/SPECS/foo.spec
Build the complete binary RPM(s)
rpmbuild -bb /your/working/directory/here/rpm/SPECS/foo.spec
Build the complete source RPM
rpmbuild -bs /your/working/directory/here/rpm/SPECS/foo.spec
Build everything
rpmbuild -ba /your/working/directory/here/rpm/SPECS/foo.spec
